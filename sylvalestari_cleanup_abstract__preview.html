<p>Plus tree inventory was an activity for collecting and compiling data. Collection block was an area within Great Forest Park region that contains different types of plant, either endemic or non-endemic plants, which serves for protection and preservation, research, science, education, support the cultivation, culture, tourism and recreation. The information about the existence of plus trees on the collection block still rare. So, plus tree inventory still necessary to fulfill the data. This research was held in Wan Abdul Rachman Great Forest Park Collection Block at February to March 2012. The aim of this research is to identify the trees which has plus tree criteria. Data collected by using line terraced layers method which placed systematically. The collected data include the types of trees, trunk diameter, branch height, trunk straightness, tree's health condition, fruit production, branch corner, sphericity form of circumference stem, and the location of the plus tree.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Mangrove forest in Lampung Mangrove Center (LMC) Margasari village at East Lampung is one area that still has good condition to keep a variety of potential to be explored such as medicinal plants. Purpose of this study was to determine of species, diversity, and functional properties of mangrove plants for medicine. Research conducted in April 2012 in village 12 Translok at Margasari village East Lampung. Data retrieval is using method checkered lines, and interviews with the public, as well as literature. Number of sample plots used 12 pieces. Data were analyzed using the formula density, relative density, frequency, relative frequency, important value index, and diversity index Shannon. Based on the result of the research have been known 7 species of plants as medicine, among others: api-api (Avicennia marina) to cure rheumatism and toothache; jeruju (Acanthus ilicifolius) cure for cancer and diabetic; nipa (Nypa fruticans) medication for asthma and diabetes; bakau (Rhizophora apiculata) for antiseptic; beluntas (Pluchea indica) for body odor; jenu (Derris trifoliata) for a laxative; and tapak kuda (Ipomoea pescaprae) to cure wounds and ulcers. Api-api is a dominant plant and widest spread because it has an important index as value high as 144.24% and frequency 67.5%. Beluntas plant has the highest density of 12,708.33 individual/ha.Mangrove forest Margasari village at village 12 Translok have low diversity, because the calculation of the index obtained values Shannon H'=0.44.</p>

Bakh and <em>D. rumphii </em>Bakh are categorized as "Fancy Wood Class I" in the Indonesian market. These woods are an important product with the highest tax compared to other grades. This study aimed to identify the distribution of six ebonies based on data global biodiversity web service (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and their climatic condition based on global climate data (WorldClim). Data from the web service, species occurrence, and climatic conditions were processed using QGIS. Species occurrence data was then extracted using GBIF occurrence. Furthermore, species occurrence data was then overlaid with climate data using point sampling tools. The results found that three ebonies scattered in the tropics and three others (<em>D. celebica </em>Bakh, <em>D. rumphii </em>Bakh, <em>D. lolin </em>Bakh) mostly occurred in Indonesia. Annual rainfall and temperature conditions ranged from 1,722 &minus; 4,013 mm and 23.4 &minus; 27.2&deg;C for the three species of ebony in Indonesia. The distribution and climatic conditions of ebony are the initial information for further research, such as the species distribution model related to climate change and the genetic conservation agenda.</p>

Structure and the Compotition of Vegetation on the Permanent Plot in the Forest of the Jambi Mendalo University Campus</h1><div><em>The Forest of the Jambi Mendalo University Campus is one of the green open spaces in the Jambi University Campus environment and in the City of Jambi which has many functions and potential to be developed. Its main function is the source of oxygen and CO2 absorbent in the campus environment, the source of biodiversity of the germplasm of Sumatra's lowland forest ecosystems and as a means of education for students, elementary school students to high schools and the people of the city of Jambi. Until now data about existing plant species and their potential is still very limited. Existing research is limited to carbon sequestration, the distribution patterns of several tree species and the physical conditions of their environment. The study was conducted in 2019. Sample plots in the form of a single plot measuring 160 x 60 meters were placed purposively at the study site. Based on the results of the inventory and identification, there were 176 species (species), 116 genera (genera) and 55 families (families). Still found species of the Dipterocarpaceae tribe, namely Shorea leprosula, Shorea parvifolia and Parashorea sp. Of the 109 species of stadia seedlings, 58 species are classified as saplings, 23 species of shrubs, 20 types of liana, 4 types of herbs, 2 types of ferns and 2 types of palm.</em></div></div><div id="pub190"><h1>400.

The data collected includes primary data and secondary data. Primary data comes from the results of observations and interviews with people who own and use palmyra palm in community forests with agroforestry patterns in Bangkala District, Jeneponto Regency. Secondary data was collected from reports and scientific publications from various agencies or institutions related to this study. The results showed that the average land area which is palmyra palm cultivated in a community forest with an agroforestry pattern is 0.66 ha/householder or about 57.39% of the total land area they own. The potential for productive palmyra palm is around 136 individuals/household or 216 individuals/ha. Palmyra palms are planted with a random cropping pattern combined with several secondary crops such as maize and cassava. Some are also trees that grow naturally and are then maintained for use by the community. Palmyra palm products are generally sold in the form of sap, sugar, mats, baskets, roofs, and home furnishings, and some are used to fulfill daily needs. All communities use the palmyra palm as a food source in the form of sap and brown sugar (100%).

RTH Perum Bumi Way Urang is in a housing complex. RTH is a place to interact socially with the local community, as well as places for other creatures to live and develop sustainably. However, the assessment of the comfort of RTH is unknown. The convenience of RTH is important in maintaining the balance of community activities. If cool conditions are created, then the comfort in doing activities is better. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of comfort of the RTH of Perum Bumi Way Urang Kalianda. The importance of this research as a reference for the government in planning and decision on the development of green space perum Bumi Way Urang is ideal and comfortable for the future. The method used to determine the comfort level of open green space is the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) method and the percentage of canopy density. THI is a formula used to determine the level of comfort in temperature and humidity while the percentage of canopy density is used to determine the density of tree canopies. In the tropics the determination of comfort quality is one of them using the formula proposed by Niewolt and Mac Gregor (1998), with the division of categories that are uncomfortable with THI values of&gt; 26, an area is said to be if the THI value is at 25-26 and comfortable if the value THI is on the interval 21-24. The results showed that the comfort level of open green space was in the morning (THI = 25-26; moderate).

The analysis method used experimental design with complete randomized design. The findings reveal that the highest combustion rate is 0.08982 gr / sec and the lowest is 0.08315 gr / sec. factors that influence differences in the rate of combustion in briquettes are caused by different levels of cempaka and teak wood density. The mixing of water adhesives also greatly affects the rate of combustion in briquettes. The higher the moisture content the lower the heating value will be.

Forest Land Tenure Rights on Indigenous Peoples in Honitetu Village West Seram District, Maluku</h1><div><p class="jbd-abs-gb-tab9"><span lang="EN">Forest land tenure systems for indigenous peoples are always debated by various parties regarding the overlapping interests and rights of forest land. Objective of this study is to analyze the types of indigenous peoples' rights to strengthen forest land tenure systems in Honitetu Village, West Seram Regency. The research approach used is Participatory Action Research by building constructs of meaning between researchers and society repeatedly to obtain an understanding of the information discussed. Data were obtained through key informant interviews and focus group discussions conducted repeatedly. The analysis was carried out at each stage of the interview and discussion by making categorization of data to get an understanding of each data obtained. The results of study show that the system of forest land tenure in indigenous communities in Honite village includes control by the whole community (petuanan), control by clan groups (soa) and control by individuals (families). In these three systems, various types of rights are attached to managing and utilizing forest resources. The set of rights contained in indigenous peoples will be even stronger if it includes the linkage of longtime dimensions, the dimensions of space for the use of vertical or horizontal space, the dimensions of the subject with fixed ownership and the dimensions of the object include the results of forest land that provides full benefits.</span></p>

Given the protection of occupational safety and health is a worker's right, various ergonomic issues were discussed in this study. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) was examined by using Standardized Nordic Questionnaire and Wong-Baker Pain Rating Scale instruments, physical-mental-social fatigue was measured by Cumulative Fatigue Symptoms Index (CFSI), and job satisfaction was tested from eight variables such as wage, employment status, accessibility, health service, living facilities, work equipment, training, and social facility. This study revealed that most of the workers suffered from intense MSDs in the shoulder, arm, wrist, hand, thigh, calf, and foot (mostly right body side). This finding was in line with the CFSI analysis.&nbsp; The common fatigue symptoms suffered by the workers were in the category of the physical dimension, such as in sub-dimensions of general fatigue, chronics fatigue, and physical disorder. The job satisfaction analysis confirmed that two variables, i.e., wage and employment status, influenced job satisfaction significantly in a positive association. Proper personal protective equipment and workaid, working techniques improvement that meets occupational safety and health standard, and safety behavior incentive should be considered as effective strategies in improving the worker's safety and health protection.</span></p>

Bio-Polyurethane Resins Derived from Liquid Fractions of Lignin for the Modification of Ramie Fibers</h1><div><p class="jbd-abs-gb-tab9">Lignin is a biopolymer from agro-forestry biomass which provides greater prospects for higher added value applications in renewable and sustainable products. In this study, technical lignin from black liquor was used as a pre-polymer for the preparation of bio-polyurethane (Bio-PU) resins. Briefly, the isolated lignin was fractionated using ethyl acetate (EtAc) and methanol (MeOH). The liquid fractions of lignin, such as lignin-EtAc (L-EtAc) and lignin-methanol (L-MeOH), were mixed with 10% of polymeric isocyanate (based on the weigth of liquid fractions) to obtain Bio-PU resins. The isolated lignin, fractionated lignin, and lignin-derived Bio-PU resins were characterized using several techniques. The obtained Bio-PU resins then were used to modify ramie fibers using vacuum impregnation method. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) revealed that the isolated lignin had quite similar characteristics to lignin standar. Fractionation of lignin with EtAc and MeOH altered its characteristics. FTIR, DSC, and TGA showed that solid fractions of lignin had similar characteristics to lignin standard and isolated lignin, while the liquid fractions had characteristics from lignin and the solvents. The absorption band of isocyanate (-N=C=O) groups was shifted to 2285 cm<sup>-1</sup> from 2240 cm<sup>-1</sup> owing to the reaction with the -OH groups in lignin, forming urethane (R-NH-C=O-R) groups at 1605 cm<sup>-1</sup> in Bio-PU resins. Thermal properties of Bio-PU resins derived from L-EtAc exhibited greater endothermic reaction compared to Bio-PU-L-MeOH. As a result, the free -N=C=O groups in Bio-PU resins have reacted with -OH groups on the surface of ramie fibers and improved its thermal properties. Modification of ramie fibers with Bio-PU resins improved the fibers' thermal stability by 15% using Bio-PU-LEtAc for 60 min of impregnation.</p>

The Change of Plant Species Composition and Plant Pattern on Management of Damar Agroforestry</h1><div><p class="jbd-abs-gb-tab9">The changes in the composition of plant species and cropping patterns have occurred in the management of Damar agroforest in Desa Kesugihan, Lampung Selatan. There are some reasons that farmers consider to make decisions in choosing plant species and cropping patterns. This study aimed to identify the reasons of farmers in the decision making of plant species selection and cropping pattern on agroforestry management of damar. Primary data collection was conducted by using an in-depth interview method on seven key informants and participant observation. The collected data is qualitative data and analyzed descriptively based on the real-life choice theory by Gladwin. The results showed that there was a change of plant species composition and cropping pattern on resin agroforestry to become cocoa agroforestry. This is affected by income, production continuity, gestation period, ease of maintenance and harvest, local knowledge and tolerance of the main plant to be planted with another crop. The dominant crop pattern was a combination of cocoa as the main plant with cengkeh, petai, tangkil, and durian. Another crop pattern was a combination between resin as the main plant species with cengkeh, durian, coconut, and petai. Comprehension and contribution from related stakeholders in the development of community forestry are fully needed to support sustainable agroforestry management.</p>

Effects of Hydrolysis on the Removal of Cured Urea-Formaldehyde Adhesive in Waste Medium-Density Fiberboard</h1><div><p class="jbd-abs-gb-tab9">The vast production of medium-density fiberboard (MDF) in the world is expected to generate a large quantity of waste MDF after its service life, which requires the recycling of waste MDF (wMDF). This work attempted to investigate the removal of cured urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins adhesive in wMDF using hydrolysis for a possible way of recycling wMDF. The wMDFs were fabricated with two kinds of recycled fibers (RFs): refiner recycled fibers (RRFs) and hammer mill recycled fibers (HRFs) from red and radiata pine. The wMDFs were also produced at different RFs contents, such as 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100%. The panels were then hydrolyzed with water and oxalic acid solution to remove the cured UF resins. The Kjeldahl method was applied to determine the nitrogen (N) content in the panel before and after hydrolysis. Regardless of the wood species and recycling process, the mass loss, pH, and formaldehyde liberation of wMDFs after hydrolysis were greater for oxalic acid than those in water, confirming a greater N content had been extracted by oxalic acid than water. The resin removal became greater as the RFs content increased. In addition, the resin removal was slightly greater in wMDFs made of HRFs than the RRFs. Moreover, red pine RFs gave higher resin removal than radiata pine. These results suggested that a proper combination of the recycling process and additives could make it possible to recycle wMDF panels in the future.</p>

<p><em>This study aims to identify traditional agroforestry models, determine the vegetation structure of the constituent plants and produce spatial data on ecological mapping of traditional agroforestry developed by farming communities in the highlands of North Central Timor Regency. This research was carried out in the North Central Timor Regency, especially in the highlands from June to August 2021. The method used in this research is descriptive exploratory method with data collection techniques consisting of observations, surveys, interviews and documentation of the highlands of North Central Timor Regency.The data analysis used in this research includes: descriptive analysis of traditional agroforestry models, vegetation structure analysis (ANVEG), and spatial ecological analysis of agroforestry. The results showed that there are two traditional agroforestry models in the highlands of North Central Timor Regency, namely: agrosilvopasture poan and agrosilvofishery mamar spread over seven plots. The results showed that there are two traditional agroforestry models in the highlands of North Central Timor Regency, namely: agrosilvopasture poan and agrosilvofishery mamar spread over seven plots. The results of vegetation analysis (ANVEG) at each level of the agroforestry model were: (1) Agrosilvopasture poan, the highest INP was at the seedling level of 67% for avocado, 182% for sapling for betel nut, 150% for pole for areca nut and 105% for tree for betel nut. . (2) Agrosilvopasture poan, the highest INP was at 190% seedling level on red bean, 123% sapling on banana plant, 300% pole on spruce, and 300% on pine tree. (3) Agrosilvopasture poan, the highest INP was at 183% seedling level on coffee plants, 300% sapling on coffee plants, 259% pole on coffee plants, and 150% trees on lamtoro plants. (4) The highest agrosilvopasture INP was at 127% seedling level for porang, 167% for turi, 300% for coffee and 154% for turi. (5) Agrosilvopasture poan, the highest INP was at 100% seedling level on coffee plants, 300% sapling on coffee plants, 128% pole on mahogany plants, and 131% on teak trees. (6) Mamar agrosilvofisheri, highest INP at 100% seedling level in coffee, 147% stake in mahogany, 154% pole in mahogany, and 119% tree in betel nut. (7) Agrosilvopasture poan, the highest INP was at 116% seedling level on pineapple plant, 138% sapling on 138 plant, 165% pole on mahogany plant, and 127% tree on candlenut plant. The results of the spatial analysis of agroforestry ecology are the distribution of traditional agroforestry in West Miomaffo District, Fatunisuan Village at an altitude of 768 masl with the agrosilvopasture poan model, Eban Village at an altitude of 1182 masl with the poan agrosilvopasture model, Suanae Village at an altitude of 939 masl with the poan agrosilvopasture model, Manusasi Village 1 is at an altitude of 988 masl with the agrosilvopasture poan model, Manusai 2 is at an altitude of 977 masl with the agrosilvopasture poan model, and East Miomaffo sub-district, namely Taekas Village is at an altitude of 748 masl with the mamar agrosilvofisheri model, and Jak Village is located at an altitude of 734 masl with agrosilvopasture poan model.</em></p>

Population Distribution of Amorphophallus at Several Altitudes in Mount Poteng, Raya Pasi Nature Reserve, West Kalimantan</h1><div><p><em>Amorphophallus </em>is a protected and endangered plant. Some <em>Amorphophallus</em> species can only grow in certain environmental conditions. Differences in environmental conditions could cause differences in morphology and distribution of <em>Amorphophallus</em>. This study aimed to obtain the morphological characteristics of <em>Amorphophallus</em> and study the distribution of its population at several altitudes in Mount Poteng, Raya Pasi Nature Reserve, West Kalimantan. The study used an exploratory survey following the river's flow at the Raya Pasi Nature Reserve, especially in Mount Poteng. The results found three species of <em>Amorphophallus</em>: <em>Amorphophallus borneensis</em> (109 individuals), <em>Amorphophallus gigas</em> (9 individuals), and <em>Amorphophallus hewittii</em> (27 individuals), showing clustered distribution patterns with a Morista index of &gt; 1. The similarity index of six comparisons for each altitude showed five altitudes with similar categories and one altitude with a very different category. The results revealed that the <em>Amorphophallus</em> distribution positively correlated with air temperature and soil temperature but negatively&nbsp;correlated with air humidity. However, all correlations were weak. The morphological differences of the three <em>Amorphophallus</em> species were in the forms of the stem pattern, stem height, and fruit shape. The distribution of <em>Amorphophallus</em> can be found at an altitude of 200 &minus; &gt; 500 masl, which is not far from the river flow.</p>

Distribusi Vertikal Asplenium nidus L. di Kawasan Hutan Imbowiari, Kepulauan Yapen, Papua (Vertical Distribution of Asplenium nidus L. in the Imbowiari Forest, Yapen Islands, Papua)</h1><div><p><em>Asplenium nidus</em> L. has an important role as one of the bio-indicators of the cenderawasih bird nest and is massively found in the Imbowiari Forest, Yapen Islands Regency, Papua. Until now, there is no study on the investigation of their vertical distribution. This study aimed to identify the vertical distribution of <em>A. nidus</em> and the relationship with the height of the host trees. The population and samples of this study were all <em>A. nidus</em> existing in the Imbowiari Forest, and the samples were all <em>A. nidus</em> that is in the observation plot. This study employed a track path method consisting of 3 transects containing 15 observation plots. The results revealed 63 <em>A. nidus</em> in the area of Imbowiari Forest with the total number of host trees of 49. The <em>A. nidus</em> and host tree relationship was shown by the equation Y = 0.014X + 1,016 with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.058. There was no correlation between the height of host trees and the vertical distribution of <em>A. nidus.</em></p>

THERMAL AND VISUAL COMFORT OF GREEN OPEN SPACE IN PALOPO CITY</h1><div><p><em>Because the quality of the urban environment is deteriorating in tandem with the city's development, Green Open Space should be viewed as more than just a complement to the city. To determine how successful green open space is at determining visitor comfort, it must be able to change the microclimate and reduce noise. The goal of this study was to find out how different levels of thermal and visual comfort are in different green open spaces in Palopo City. This study took place in Palopo, in the South Sulawesi region. The goal of this study is to look at the level of thermal comfort in Palopo City's five green open spaces, as well as people's impressions of thermal and visual comfort. The thermal and visual comfort in the five Green Open Space (RTH) locations were classified as uncomfortable because they surpassed the conventional comfort requirements, particularly temperature &gt; 27<sup>o</sup>C. The findings of interviews with visitors' opinions of thermal comfort in five moderately sized green open spaces revealed that, due to the lack of vegetated areas, the green open space in these places could not yet provide freshness connected to temperature for urban regions. Visual comfort perceptions of respondents in five green open areas with moderate categories: Lapangan Pancasila, Lapangan Gaspa, and Taman Baca. Meanwhile, the other two green open areas, Lapangan Pancasila and Taman I Love Palopo, are rated as high.

Rubberwood is mainly planted for latex production and as latex production declines with age, rubberwood is generally felled. The logging waste and industrial waste of rubberwood-based products could be utilized as raw materials to produce biomass pellets. The quality of biomass pellets can be increased through torrefaction, a thermal process in the temperature range of 200-300&deg;C under an inert atmosphere. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of torrefaction on the characteristics of rubberwood pellets. The torrefaction of rubberwood pellets was conducted using the Counter-Flow Multi Baffle (COMB) reactor, a reactor that could perform torrefaction within a short residence time of up to 5 min. The temperature used in this study was 200&deg;C, 250&deg;C, dan 300&deg;C with a residence time of 3 min. The color change, physical properties, chemical composition, and heating value were evaluated. The results showed that the pellets color changed from light brown into black pellets, showing the overall color change (E*) of 29,12, 54,27, and 66,71, after torrefaction at 200&deg;C, 250&deg;C, and 300&deg;C, respectively. The equilibrium moisture content of the pellets decreased from 12,25% to 3,54%. The water immersion test also showed that the torrefied pellets have a better hydrophobicity, which is an advantage when pellets are stored in a humid condition. The oven-dry density of pellet decreased from 1,15 g/cm<sup>3</sup> to 1,09 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 1,04 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and 0,96 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, after torrefaction at temperatures of 200&deg;C, 250&deg;C, and 300&deg;C, respectively. Torrefaction caused a decrease of cellulose and hemicellulose contents, an increase of lignin content, and a remarkable increase in the heating value of 1,71-18,32% with increasing torrefaction temperature.

Tree Health Management Strategy in Cianjur Urban Forest</h1><div><p><span lang="EN-US">Urban forests have a high intensity of exposure from external factors such as air pollution and human activity disturbances. As a result, fallen trees and tree defects often occurred and can endanger the people around the city. This study aimed to assess tree health in Cianjur Urban Forest and formulate tree health management strategies. The tree health assessment used the Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) method. The management strategy was formulated using the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) Matrix and Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM). Tree sampling using FHM plots determined about 534 trees from 30 species. The results showed that Cianjur Urban Forest had high land productivity and biodiversity. The canopy condition was 86.41% in good condition. The results revealed that 92.70%, 5.34%, 1.31%, and 0.56% of the trees were in healthy, lightly, moderately, and heavily damaged conditions, respectively. The tree species that suffered the most damage was <em>Acacia denticulosa</em>. The most types of tree damage were leaf damage and rotten wood. Cianjur Urban Forest benefits the community as a place for natural tourism, sports, education, and expand job opportunities. However, the management of Cianjur Urban Forest has not been implemented effectively. There are three priority strategies to improve tree health management in Cianjur Urban Forest, i.e., conducting the assessment, evaluation, and action on damaged trees, community cooperation, institutional strengthening development programs, and optimizing collaboration and government commitment with managers.</span></p>

The Removal of Cured Urea-Formaldehyde Adhesive towards Sustainable Medium Density Fiberboard Production: A Review</h1><div><p><span lang="IN"><span lang="EN-US">Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is an engineered wood product that has density and specific gravity similar to solid wood, ranging from 600 to 800 kg/m<sup>3</sup> of density and 0.6 to 0.8 of specific gravity. This makes MDF suitable to partially replace solid wood, particularly for interior application. Approximately over than 100 million m<sup>3</sup> of MDF are produced in 2020, resulting in a large amount of waste MDF will be generated in the next 20 years. MDF is produced using urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins adhesive. UF resins adhesive is a poly-condensation product of urea and formaldehyde via an </span><span lang="EN-AU">alkaline</span><span lang="EN-US"> acid two-step reaction. Sustainable MDF production is required as the world is facing climate change and deforestation. Recycling is a way to support sustainable production in the engineered wood products manufacturing. Many attempts have been done to find ways to recycle waste MDF. The main problem is UF resins, which bond the MDF panel fibers. In order to re-manufacture the waste MDF into new recycled MDF, UF resins should be eliminated from the waste MDF before being used. The presence of UF resins in MDF can interfere with the utilization of the recycled fibers, whether it will be used as a raw material for new MDF or other composite products. This paper reviews the process of removal of cured UF resins from waste MDF panel by considering the hydrolytic stability of cured UF resins for MDF recycling, providing a comprehensive review of how cured UF resins can be removed from waste MDF and characterization of recycled fibers obtained from recycling prior to re-manufacturing of recycled MDF panel</span>.</span></p>

This study was conducted from December 2020 to March 2021 using a qualitative descriptive method as in-depth interviews and questionnaires with assessment indicators. Respondents were chosen randomly from the entire population using the Slovin formula. The results showed that the institutional effectiveness of LMDH Sumber Makmur still tended to decrease. The confidence level of farmers in the PS program was only around 28.9%, and the level of understanding was 26.7%. The results also showed a low percentage value of farmer participation, external support, the availability of facilities, and gender perspective. Consequently, the government needs to monitor institutions and community groups running PS programs to see institutional developments in each location. Institutional development is essential as an entrance for people to manage forests independently.</p>

The longstanding efforts have been conducted to overcome this problem, but the success was relatively low. This study aims to determine the factors that affect the extent of forest and peat fires in Indonesia. The analysis of forest fires was carried out on three major islands, i.e. Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua using time series data from 1969 to 2012. The data were analyzed using econometric models. The results indicated that the factors affecting the forest and peat fires included the price of logs, export prices of CPO, el nino, budget of the Ministry of Forestry, the economic crisis and the number of hotspots. The identified determinant which has a major impact on the extent of forest and peat fires is the number of hotspots. Controlling the number of hotspots significantly reduced the magnitude of forest fires. For that reason, there is a need for a paradigm shift in the control of forest fires from forest fire fighting activities into preventive effort by reducing the number or preventing the occurrence of hotspots as an early indication of a forest fire.</p>

Utilization of Lignin from the Waste of Bioethanol Production as a Mortar Additive</h1><div><p>Lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer, exceeded only by cellulose, and comprises 15-25% of the dry weight of woody plants, with around 285,000 tons/year of production capacity globally. This study aims to utilize the lignin obtained from the waste of bioethanol production from oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) as a mortar additive. The use of mortar as a material for road construction is increasing, but its long time hardening is causing problems such as traffic jams. Lignin can be used as an additive to shorten the hardening time of mortar. Lignin was isolated at various NaOH concentrations and temperatures of OPEFB pretreatment for bioethanol production. The workability of the slump and compressive strength of mortars generated were further tested. Lignin from OPEFB can be used as a water reducer in the mortar with improved workability as much as 24.4% compared to controls. The addition of lignin could also increase the compressive strength at the mortar age of 7 and 28 days compared to the commercial lignosulfonate and control on the various water-cement ratios. The setting time of mortar with the lignin addition increased rapidly, reaching up to 80% at the 7 days, indicating that curing time is getting shorter. The most remarkable improvement of compressive strength with suitable workability and high-quality concrete was reached by 1% lignin addition and 0.45 water-cement ratio with compressive strength 38.81 N/mm<sup>2</sup> at 28 days.</p>

Competitiveness and Determinants of Indonesian Plywood Export </h1><div><p>Since 1998, Indonesia has been the largest plywood exporter in the world. However, at this time, Indonesia's position no longer dominates; even the plywood export volume and value tend to decline. This condition is determined by many factors and is closely related to the competitiveness concept. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the competitiveness, determinants, and export potential of Indonesian plywood. This study uses panel data from 11 major trading partner countries from 2004 to 2020. The data analysis method used in this study includes Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), gravity model, and trade potential analysis. The results show that Indonesian plywood has strong competitiveness in 11 major trading partner countries with a positive growth trend. The estimation of the gravity model shows that the importer population, economic distance, and the RCA index have a positive effect on Indonesian plywood exports. In contrast, Indonesia's real GDP, importers' GDP, exchange rates, and export prices are negatively affected. The population of importers is the most significant elasticity variable. Indonesia still has the potential to expand in 11 major trading partner countries because of the plywood under-trade current condition. So, development efforts on plywood exports should be aimed at under-trade countries and large populations.</p>

Electrocoagulation was applied with the aim to remove natural organic matter in the sample, using aluminim as electrodes, with the particular purpose to study the effect of potentials. The treated water was then subjected to adsorption process at different contact times and the performance of the process was evaluated in term of the reduction of the absorbance at maximum wavelength. The performance of the method was defined in term of absorbance reduction at the maximum wavelength of 226 nm, which was determined by scanning the original sample at the wavelength ranging from 200 to 700 nm. According to literature, the maximum wavelength of 226 nm is commonly assigned to benzene structure, most likely from the Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate (ABS) used in detergents. The results obtained indicate that for electrocoagulation process, the highest reduction in the absorbance was achieved using potential of 10 volt. Adsorption process was found to result in the diminish of peak at 226 nm, reflecting that the organic pollutant associated with this wavelength has been completely removed from the water.

Understanding Resident Intention and Behavior toward Water Conservation Initiative in the Upstream of West Java, Indonesia</h1><div><p>Upstream areas have long been targeted as the priority of water conservation initiatives. While earlier studies often considered underlying socio-psychological factors determining residents' intention and behaviors in water conservation, studies that focused on the resident's intention and behavior in upstream areas, where water is abundant, remain underexplored. The current study used socio-psychological constructs of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), i.e., subjective norm, attitudes toward behavior, and perceived behavioral control, to analyze the determinants of water conservation intention and behavior in two villages upstream of West Java (i.e., Cibeusi and Sanca villages), Indonesia. A total of 200 usable questionnaires were retrieved. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the linkages and strength of relationships among constructs. There was evidence that residents perceived behavioral control exerted the most significant influence on residents' water conservation intention and behavior. Moreover, perceived behavioral control was an effective mediator of the linkage between attitude and residents' intention and behavior. The findings confirmed the suitability of TPB in explaining interrelationships among determinant factors that explain residents' intention and behavior, albeit with different mechanisms and effects. The study implied that increasing awareness of the value of water conservation would significantly affect residents' attitudes, which subsequently increased their willingness to perform water conservation efforts.</p>

Analysis of the Urban Forest Status in Bandar Lampung City</h1><div><p>Urban forest is one form of green open space. Urban forests play an important role in maintaining the sustainability of ecological functions in a city. This role could only run optimally with the availability of urban forests. The purpose of this study is to analyze the status of land ownership and analyze the efforts that can be made in maintaining urban forests. This study used image analysis, interviews, and field observations. From the results of this study, the status of urban forests based on the Mayor of Bandar Lampung Decree in 2010 had different statuses at each location. The urban forest ownership does not exclusively belong to the government. Of the 5 locations, only 1 location owned by the Bandar Lampung City Government, with 1 location that is not recognized (problematic), 1 location did not have a certificate of rights yet, and 2 other locations were private locations. The best effort that could be made to maintain the existence of urban forests is to control urban forest land as ownership in the name of the City Government with the support of certain regulations that can be done.</p>

Uji Perkecambahan Beberapa Benih Pohon Kehutanan pada Media Lumpur Settling pond dengan Pemberian Kompos</h1><div><p>Various obstacles are often experienced by mining companies in carrying out revegetation activities on post-mining land, one of the obstacles faced is related to the deficit of topsoil stock. Procurement of topsoil stock is not always possible, especially for small-scale mining companies and mining companies that are constrained in terms of cost. Procurement of new materials can be suppressed by utilizing materials that are already available in the mining area. Settling pond sludge is waste that is routinely dumped into disposal areas and has the potential to accumulate, but also has the potential to be used as material for other activities. The purpose of this study was to identify the potential use of settling pond mud as a planting medium to replace topsoil by testing the germination of seeds and the viability of sprouts planted by direct seeding method on settling pond mud media added with compost. This experiment used a completely randomized design with 4 levels of compost treatment applied to several types of revegetation plants, namely Acacia mangium, Senna siamea, Falcataria moluccana, and Albizia saman. The results show that the settling pond media has the potential to be used as a medium for growing revegetation plants. The addition of compost had a significant effect on the germination parameters and the viability of the sprouts. In general, the media with the addition of 50% and 75% compost gave the best germination response and germination viability.</p>

The area is difficult to reach, and to date, there is no effective waste management system applied. Waste management cannot be separated from the involvement of men and women; hence, a model that can accommodate the community's interests and how gender plays a role in that model is needed. This study aims to develop an appropriate gender-based waste management model to overcome these problems. The study was conducted using mixed methods of Sequential Explanatory. Quantitative data were analyzed through 3 stages: editing, coding, and tabulation in tables and diagrams. Qualitative data were analyzed descriptively through 3 stages, that are reduction, presentation, and verification. The results showed that the community's knowledge and attitudes, both men and women, were relatively high, but not accompanied by their behavior. Women tend to have a higher level of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior than men. The waste management model that can be developed is an integrated waste management model that can accommodate all society levels. This model divides roles between the community, government, and the private sector. In this model, women have a more significant role in separating waste and recycling plastic waste into handicraft products.
